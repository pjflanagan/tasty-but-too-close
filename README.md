# Tasty But Too Close

- 1. `make download`: Download the vidoes (will automatically skip ones that are present)
- 2. `make clean`: Optionally, clean up the download folder
- 3. `make crop` Crop the video
- 4. `make redo` If you don't like it, redo the video 
- 5. Copy the caption text, airdrop to yourself, post on insta using phone

TODO:
- 6. Or `make skip` if this video is weird and not good then skip it, which will save it to the skipped log for reference
